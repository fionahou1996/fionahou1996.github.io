    <p>It's her way to relax when she has pressure. Other people pat cats when stressed or depressed, but not her. She tried patting cats, but then found out that she's allergic to it. Sad...</p>

    <p>Who also have an awesome taste in films~</p>
    <p>Her favorite is Harry Potter (although she admitted that Dr. Strange is better than Fantastic Beasts). She always says “oh Tarantino is awesome”, but inside she don’t like his movies… She hasn’t even finished Kill Bill.</p>
    <p>She may tell you that she’s a fan of Wes Anderson, but that’s only half true—everyone loves Wes Anderson. Her favorite is actually  <a href="woodyallen.html"><strong>WOODY ALLEN</strong></a>. Yes, that old man with bad reputation. But as a hopeless romantic, an imaginative dreamer, and a complete complete idealist, can she resist Vicky Christina Barcelona or Midnight in Paris? NO. Other favorites of hers are Richard Linklater, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan. </p>
    <p>Wait is James Franco mentioned yet? No? Okay she LOVES James Franco. He’s talented and also weird enough for her to fall in love with. Franco is her goal, although she has never told anyone. She likes the way he treats life and the way he makes movies. Also the way he posts photos on Instagram. </p>

    <p>Now, she's a semi-professional photographer! So how's she inspired?. . .</p>
